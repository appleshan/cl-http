<ul><p><li><b>ACL (JKF) 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0:</b> CL-HTTP runs under Allegro Common Lisp (ACL) for UNIX, Mac
OS X and Windows. The server is considered <a

<p><li><b>ACL (OBC) 4.2, 4.3, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0:</b> At present, CL-HTTP runs in multi-threaded
mode under Allegro Common Lisp (ACL) for UNIX, and has been tested under SunOS 4.1.3x, Solaris 2.4
and 2.5 on Sun Microsystems workstations.  The ACL CL-HTTP server is considered <a
href="/cl-http/sources/acl/obc/-read-me-.text"><b>released </b></a> software when running at the
