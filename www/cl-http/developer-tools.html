Testing</b><dd> CL-HTTP includes a facility for flogging a Web
applications (<a
href="/cl-http/show-documentation?HTTP:FLOG-SERVER">http:flog-server</a>)
and URL metering tools (<a
href="/cl-http/show-documentation?HTTP:WITH-METERED-RESPONSE">http:with-metered-response</a>).
The flogger works by replaying log files and making requests of a server
a specified rate.  This tools can be used in conjunction with Lisp
metering tools to improve the performance of CL-HTTP and Web
applications atop it.  In addition to flogging GET, the impleentation
also handles the POST method.  (This approach to performance was
originally inspired by Robert Thau's C-based Web Monkey, which he used
to stress test Apache under UNIX.)

Browser</b><dd><a

a suite of browser tools useful for testing servers, <i>e.g.,</i> acts
as a HTTP 1.1 client. This code base has provided the foundation for
most C-based browsers and servers developed to date, most notably NCSA
Mosaic which grew to prominence as a graphical user interface to the
CERN library.

API</b><dd> <a

The W3C <a href="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Jigsaw/">Jigsaw server</a>
includes a <a
href="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Jigsaw/User/FAQ.html#client-hotjava">
client API</a> that can drive Sun's <a
href="http://www.javasoft.com/HotJava/index.html">HotJava Browser</a> as
an HTTP 1.1 compliant client. The Java servlet notion was derived from
CL-HTTP object-based response functions by the implementor while
visiting MIT.
