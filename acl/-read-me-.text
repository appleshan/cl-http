There are two ports of CL-HTTP to ACL.

	* http:obc; Olivier Clarisse Port for ACL versions 4, 5, 6 and ACLPC

	* http:jkf; John Foderaro Port at the server level for ACL 5.0.1 and 6.
                    Components beyond the server may be shakey and the server
                    port may be missing features present in other ports.

If you make any improvements, please send a note to:
bug-acl-cl-http@ai.mit.edu and arrange for integration of your changes
into the distributed sources.
